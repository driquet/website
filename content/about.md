Hello, **I'm Damien Riquet**, a Research Engineer with a passion for exploring
innovative solutions in Cybersecurity. Welcome to my website, where I'm
thrilled to share my journey, projects, and discoveries in the world of
research and technology

Since an early age, I've been captivated by the wonders of science and
technology, driving me to pursue a career in research to actively contribute to
advancements that shape our world. My journey began at the University of
Lille, France, where I completed a **PhD on Network Security, Language and
Distribution**. After that, I joined **Stormshield**, a network security
provider, as kernel developer. Later on, IÂ became part of **Vade**, an email
security provider, first as Research Engineer, now as Lead Research Engineer.

My current research interests revolve around **Cybersecurity**, **Machine
Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**, combining insights from
various fields to create meaningful and impactful outcomes.

As **Lead Research Engineer** at **Vade**, I take pride in leading innovative
projects that benefit both our customers and the academic community. This
includes prototyping new approaches using cutting-edge technologies like
Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and NLP. Additionally, I enjoy providing
insightful propositions to our customers and actively publishing our work in
academic conferences.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone
interested in the marvels of research. If you have any questions, collaboration
proposals, or just want to say hello, feel free to [reach out](mailto:d.riquet@gmail.com).
