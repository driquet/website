## Summary
Hello, **I'm Damien Riquet**, a Research Engineer with a passion for exploring innovative solutions in Cybersecurity. Welcome to my website, where I'm thrilled to share my journey, projects, and discoveries in the world of research and technology.

Since an early age, I've been captivated by the wonders of science and technology, driving me to pursue a career in research to actively contribute to advancements that shape our world. My journey began at the University of Lille, France, where I completed a **PhD on Network Security, Language and Distribution**. After that, I joined **Stormshield**, a network security provider, as kernel developer. Later on, I became part of **Vade**, an email security provider, first as Research Engineer, now as Lead Research Engineer.

My current research interests revolve around **Cybersecurity**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**, combining insights from various fields to create meaningful and impactful outcomes.

As **Lead Research Engineer** at **Vade**, I take pride in leading innovative projects that benefit both our customers and the academic community. This includes prototyping new approaches using cutting-edge technologies like Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and NLP. Additionally, I enjoy providing insightful propositions to our customers and actively publishing our work in academic conferences.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the marvels of research. If you have any questions, collaboration proposals, or just want to say hello, feel free to [reach out](mailto:d.riquet@gmail.com).

## About me
Proud father of two, I live near Lille, France. I like spending time with my family, playing disc golf and video games, or finding geocaches. I also like to make jokes and puns.

I love computer science and cybersecurity. While my go-to languages are Golang and C, I'm learning Rust at the moment. I am a quick learner and always up for a good challenge.


Outside of work, I'm actively involved in various pursuits. Since 2015, I have served as a geocaching reviewer, and I currently sit on the board of my children's kindergarten association.

Curiosity best describes me: I have a voracious appetite for knowledge, often immersing myself in articles, GitHub repositories, and educational videos to understand diverse subjects.

## Main skills

**Software development**

- Implementation of backend systems that are both user-friendly and efficient, based on microservices architecture, capable of scaling to handle large volumes of requests.
- Designing robust and critical applications through comprehensive testing methodologies including unit testing, regression testing, and fuzzing.
- Leveraging experience in Golang and C to provide expertise in both languages.
- Advanced debugging skills to address bugs and identify optimization opportunities for improving application performance. Knowledge of underlying layers of systems, compilers and languages.
- Good knowledge of day-to-day tooling, including Git, Gitlab CI, Docker, and (a little of) Kubernetes.

**Technical leadership**

- Leading technical projects, including complex systems, while keeping them as simple as possible.
- Mentoring developers, reviewing code, establishing good engineering practices.
- Delivering technical presentations both internally and externally.
- Participating in the recruitment: review and interview of candidates.

**Research and innovation**

- Supervising PhD students and collaborating with public research laboratories.
- Conducting state-of-the-art academic research, in order to implement innovative solutions in industrial settings.
- Publishing computer science contributions in workshops and conferences.
