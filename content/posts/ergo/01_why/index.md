## Introduction
Since graduating in 2011, I’ve been living the classic software and research engineer lifestyle: glued to a desk, endlessly typing and clicking away on my devices. Time flies, it feels like just yesterday I started, but here we are, and I’m wondering, does this make me ancient? Aside from meetings, coffee breaks, and the occasional "nature calls" moment, my daily movement level rivals that of a particularly lazy housecat.

Back in 2015, I first came across the concept of ergonomics and learned about the risks of having a poorly adapted work setup. I also discovered the various ways to minimize the chances of injury while improving efficiency. Even though I wasn’t experiencing any discomfort and was happy with my setup, my curiosity led me down the rabbit hole of exploring ergonomics further.

This series of articles takes a deep dive into different aspects of ergonomics, with a particular focus on keyboards and mice. Originally, it was meant to be a single article, but it turned out so lengthy that I decided to break it into smaller pieces, making it easier for you to explore the topics that interest you most. This series of articles focuses on two main concerns. First, the health aspect: how to prevent serious issues, like the need for surgery, later in life. Second, how embracing an ergonomic setup can boost our efficiency and productivity in everyday tasks.

This article will explore the risks associated with a traditional workspace setup, like Repetitive Strain Injuries, and explain why it's important to take steps to prevent them.

## Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)

### Definition
Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is a group of conditions caused by repetitive movements, overuse, or maintaining awkward positions for extended periods. It primarily affects muscles, tendons, and nerves, leading to symptoms like pain, tingling, stiffness, and weakness. Common among those who work with keyboards and mice, RSI can significantly impact daily life if not addressed early.

One of the most well-known injuries is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), a condition caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. This pressure can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in the hand and fingers.

### A Universal Workplace Challenge
Repetitive Strain Injuries are a concern across various professions {{< cite "u.s.bureauoflaborstatistics2020" >}}. Retail and service workers, such as cashiers and meat packers, often face risks due to repetitive scanning or packing tasks. Similarly, manual laborers and industrial workers, including those in construction, carpentry, or assembly lines, are at risk from frequent use of hand tools and forceful tasks. Healthcare professionals like sonographers, dentists, and surgeons also experience high rates of RSI, particularly carpal tunnel syndrome, due to sustained awkward wrist postures and repetitive motions.

Numbers are better than words: in 2021, 9% of U.S. adults aged 18 and over reported repetitive strain injuries within the past three months {{< cite "garnett2023" >}}.

While RSI affects a wide range of professions, office workers face unique challenges. Let’s dive deeper into the specific risks posed by prolonged computer use.

### Computer Use in the Workplace
Now, let’s shift our attention to office workers, those with sedentary jobs spent primarily at a computer. The prolonged use of keyboards, mice, and monitors can lead to several common RSIs, including:

- **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**, often caused by repetitive wrist movements, poor posture, or extended periods of typing.
- **Tendonitis** in the wrist or forearm, stemming from continuous typing or mouse usage.
- **Tenosynovitis**, a condition linked to repetitive scrolling or gripping motions, resulting in inflammation of the tendons in the wrist or fingers.
- **Neck and Shoulder Strain**, frequently brought on by poor desk posture, non-ergonomic monitor positioning, or long hours at the computer.

Although repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) are less common among office workers, it’s still not surprising for computer users to experience these injuries. On average, employees make about 2,000 keystrokes per hour while using a computer, along with approximately 600 mouse clicks per hour {{< cite "taylor2007" >}}. In some cases, this can increase to as many as 9,000 keystrokes per hour {{< cite "stenberg2015" >}}.

While there are many contradicting articles on the subjects, several articles found a relationship between mouse use duration and the development of hand-arm symptoms {{< cite "andersen2003;ijmker2007" >}}. Other studies also linked the mouse use to an increased risk of moderate-to-severe pain in the neck and right shoulder {{< cite "cook2000;brandt2004" >}}.

### Costly injuries
RSIs, particularly Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, impose significant economic and personal costs. In the United States, while the data is older, a study estimated between 400,000 and 500,000 carpal tunnel release surgeries were performed annually back in 1995 {{< cite "palmer1995" >}}. The economic impact of this condition is estimated to exceed $2 billion annually. Recovery times post-surgery vary based on job demands. The average time to return to work is between 25 and 46 days {{< cite "outpatientsurgerymagazine2024" >}}. In France, in 2022, 124,000 surgeries were performed for carpal tunnel syndrome, making it the second most recognized occupational disease {{< cite "santepubliquefrance2024" >}}.

Beyond surgery and lost workdays, RSIs can lead to chronic pain, reduced quality of life, and long-term disability. Implementing preventive measures, such as using an ergonomic setup, is crucial to mitigate these substantial costs.

## The Long-Term Benefits of Ergonomic Improvement
Ergonomic improvements offer lasting benefits at every level. For individuals, they help prevent health issues like repetitive strain injuries and chronic pain, reducing the risk of disability and improving quality of life. A comfortable, well-designed workspace also boosts efficiency and eliminates unnecessary healthcare costs.

For employers, the advantages are clear: healthier employees mean higher productivity, fewer sick days, and lower turnover. When workers feel valued and cared for, they’re more likely to stay, reducing hiring and training expenses.

On a societal level, better workplace ergonomics lead to fewer injuries and illnesses, easing the burden on healthcare systems and lowering overall healthcare costs. A healthier workforce ultimately benefits everyone, fueling economic growth and improving collective well-being.

## Conclusion
What can we do to avoid the need for surgery by the age of 50? The answer lies in optimizing how we use our devices. The good news is that these improvements don’t just prevent long-term injury, they can also make us more efficient and productive. This is what led me, in late 2015, to dive deep into the world of keyboard layouts, ergonomic keyboards, and related topics. In this series of articles, I'll share a condensed version of the key insights I've gathered on this journey. First stop, [Touch Typing]({{< ref "/posts/ergo/02_touch-typing/index.md" >}})!
