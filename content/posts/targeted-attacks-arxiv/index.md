I'm proud to announce that our latest article pre-print has been published on arxiv! It has also been submitted to a journal, and hopefully be published in the next few months.

*TL;DR*: Cybercrime, a major cause of financial losses and intellectual property theft, often begins with email, the primary means of corporate communication. Spear phishing or Business Email Compromise are rare, damaging email threats. However, literature on targeted attacks is inconsistent, hindering security vendors and researchers from mitigating them. This study introduces targeted attacks, discusses targeted-attack-detection techniques, and presents text-based attacks, comparing non-targeted and targeted variants.
