In my free time (when I have some), I enjoy solving programming challenges. December is always a special time because each morning I get to tackle a new AdventOfCode challenge. At work, we've created a communication channel for enthusiasts to share in this experience. Recently, for the second time, my colleague Antoine Honor√© and I organized an internal coding challenge, called YesWeCode, structured as a Capture The Flag event. It was a huge success, and since I spent so much of my free time creating the challenges, I wanted to share them publicly.

If you're interested in a programming challenge, check out the challenges I created on the following GitHub repository. Each challenge's goal is to find a flag (the answer to the challenge). The topics covered include steganography, algorithms, graph theory, file manipulation, and more. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
